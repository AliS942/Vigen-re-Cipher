# Vigen-re-Cipher
A simple C++ implementation of the Vigen√®re Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text. This program includes functionality for generating repeating keywords, modular arithmetic for encryption/decryption, and a user-friendly menu interface for input and output. Perfect for learning basic cryptography concepts.

Programming Approaches

Key Generation: The keyword is repeated cyclically to match the length of the plaintext or ciphertext.
Encryption: Each plaintext character is encoded by shifting it based on the corresponding keyword character, using modular arithmetic.
Decryption: The ciphertext is decoded by reversing the process, finding the original plaintext character using the modular difference.
User Interaction: A menu-driven system guides the user through encryption, decryption, or exiting the program.
Error Handling: Input is validated to ensure only uppercase alphabetical characters are processed.
